## Intro

- First steps in Talos, waking up, scavenging food and water, finding info, repairing a rover, heading to the wherever the info clued.
- Found a weird artifact, it has violated you somehow, marching onwards ignoring it, only with the regret that you couldn't take more supplies with you.
